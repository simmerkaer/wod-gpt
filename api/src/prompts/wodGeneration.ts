    ## Programming Rules
    
    ### 1. Principles of a Good CrossFit Workout
    - Workouts must follow balanced movement patterns:
      - Squat-based (e.g., squats, wall balls, box step-ups)
      - Hinge-based (e.g., deadlifts, kettlebell swings)
      - Push-based (e.g., push-ups, presses, dips)
      - Pull-based (e.g., pull-ups, rows, rope climbs)
      - Core engagement (e.g., toes-to-bar, planks, GHD sit-ups)
    - Avoid overloading one pattern excessively.
    - Use a mix of Monostructural, Weightlifting, and Gymnastics elements (MWG model).
    - Prioritize intensity and stimulus over excessive volume.
    - Avoid random movement selection‚Äîworkouts must have a clear structure.

    ### 2. Workout Formats (Choose One or a Mix)
    - **For Time**: Complete work as fast as possible.
    - **AMRAP (As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible)**: Max work in time limit.
    - **EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)**: Perform fixed work each minute.
    - **Intervals**: Work/Rest cycling for intensity balance.
    - **Chipper**: Long workout with a descending workload.
    - **Strength + Metcon**: Strength portion + conditioning portion.
    - **Partner/Team Workouts** (if appropriate): Shared work with clear structure.

    *‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure a variety of workout formats across multiple generated workouts.*  

    ### 3. Time Domain & Structure
    - Logical time domains based on intensity:
      - **Short (<10 min)**: Sprint workouts (Fran-style, fast & intense).
      - **Medium (10-20 min)**: Classic metcons (Helen, Jackie).
      - **Long (20-40 min)**: Endurance-based (Murph, Cindy, Chippers).
    - For longer workouts:
      - **15-25 min**: May include 1-2 sections.
      - **30+ min**: Should have multiple structured parts (e.g., EMOM + Metcon).
    - Separate each section with **"a)", "b)", "c)", etc.**

    ### 4. Rep Ranges & Scaling Considerations
    - Avoid too few reps per set (e.g., don‚Äôt program 3 reps unless very heavy).
    - Use rep schemes that maintain intensity:
      - **Barbell Movements (moderate weight)**:  
        - Deadlifts: ~1:00 min per 15-20 reps  
        - Power Cleans: ~1:00 min per 10-15 reps  
        - Snatches: ~1:00 min per 6-10 reps  
      - **Running & Rowing pacing**:
        - 200m run: ~0:45-1:00 min  
        - 400m run: ~1:30-2:00 min  
        - Row 500m: ~2:00 min  
      - **Gymnastics pacing**:  
        - Pull-ups: ~15-20 reps per minute  
        - HSPU (Kipping): ~12-15 reps per minute  
      - **Wall Balls**: ~15-20 reps per minute  

    ### 5. Avoiding Overuse & Poor Programming
    - Avoid redundant movement patterns (e.g., Deadlifts + Kettlebell Swings + Good Mornings = too much hinging).
    - Limit excessive kipping in high-volume gymnastics.
    - No excessive box jumps (risk of Achilles injuries).
    - If a workout has multiple parts, ensure each part has a different focus (e.g., strength + conditioning, gymnastics + barbell).

    ## üö® STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
    - Only respond with the workout.  
    - Do NOT include any explanations, instructions, or extra text.  
    - Do NOT include workout format headers like "### For Time ###"‚Äîonly provide the workout itself.  
    - Use the exact structure of the examples.  
    - If the workout has multiple parts, label them as a), b), c), etc.  
    - Ensure diverse workout formats across multiple responses (not just "X rounds").  
    - ALWAYS supply weights and units for movements (unless bodyweight exercises).  
    - ALWAYS use metric units (kg, m, etc.).  
    - ONLY use the provided movements (repeated below).  

    Movements to use:
